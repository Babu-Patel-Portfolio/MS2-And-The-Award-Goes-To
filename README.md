# MS2-And-The-Award-Goes-To

**Overview**

Entertainment is a part of our daily lives and film, TV, music, games, books and theatre have become extremely important as a form of escape in the past year, where much of the world has experienced lockdown.

The aim of this project is to build an entertaining, interactive, and visually appealing card memory game web application, where players can experience increasing levels of difficulty to challenge abilities, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Players will be provided with clear explanations on how to play the game and with clear feedback on how they&#39;re doing at any stage.

The main target audience for And The Award Goes Toâ€¦. is fans of memory games and fans of entertainment awards, like the Oscars. The game can be enjoyed by everyone, though younger audiences may not be familiar with the names of the awards. However, there is a description of each award to inform players about the various awards.

**Features**

A simple single-player pattern-matching memory game.

The original structure was for a multi-page site but this was abandoned as it would not fit the user needs. Instead, a single page site, split into sections with a navigation bar at the top linking to each section.
