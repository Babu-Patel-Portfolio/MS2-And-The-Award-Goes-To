# MS2-And-The-Award-Goes-To

**Overview**

Entertainment is a part of our daily lives and film, TV, music, games, books and theatre have become extremely important as a form of escape in the past year, where much of the world has experienced lockdown.

The aim of this project is to build an entertaining, interactive, and visually appealing card memory game web application, where players can experience increasing levels of difficulty to challenge abilities, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Players will be provided with clear explanations on how to play the game and with clear feedback on how they&#39;re doing at any stage.

The main target audience for And The Award Goes Toâ€¦. is fans of memory games and fans of entertainment awards, like the Oscars. The game can be enjoyed by everyone, though younger audiences may not be familiar with the names of the awards. However, there is a description of each award to inform players about the various awards.

**Features**

A simple single-player pattern-matching memory game.

## UX Design

**Scope**

For the audience I want to present a fun and enjoyable game that is easy to understand and can be accessed on mobile devices, laptops and desktops. If they enjoy the game they might tell their friends.

**Structure**

The original structure was for a multi-page site but this was abandoned as it would not fit the user needs. Instead, a single page site, split into sections with a navigation bar at the top linking to each section.

*[Wireframes](https://github.com/BabusDublinCoding/MS2-And-The-Award-Goes-To/tree/master/wireframes)*

- The wireframes were created using Balsamic, a popular wireframing tool, which Code Institute student can avail of as a fully licenced product.
- This was done during the early stages of the project and demonstrates the structure of the website on different devices including mobile, tablet and desktop.

**Surface**

*Design*

**Colour Scheme**

Colours associated with award ceremonies tend to be warm and vibrant colours. Red carpets and gold statues. I wanted to add a palette to the website to convey this, along with an image of glamour an sophistication.
